# ☕ Chai aur JavaScript

## 📖 About

Welcome to the **"Chai aur JavaScript"** repository! 🚀  
This is a comprehensive resource for learning and mastering JavaScript — from fundamentals to advanced concepts — entirely inspired by the teachings of [**Hitesh Choudhary**](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary).  
Every concept covered here is something I’ve learned while following his tutorials, and the code is written alongside his lessons.
